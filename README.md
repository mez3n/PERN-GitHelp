This reposirtory is for the database course project in which we used PERN stack. 
GIT HELP is social media website in which people in need can get donations in all types such as blood, funds,clothes, medical equipment.
You can request a representative to come to your address to pickup you donated things.
There is a feature called groups in which addicted people can talk about their addiction and get over it with help from volunteers.

This project is not complete however frontend and backend are complete only the integration is missing.
